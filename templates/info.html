                        WHO - "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
                        <br><br> Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory 
                        illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical 
                        problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely 
                        to develop serious illness.
                        <br><br> The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, 
                        the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or 
                        using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 
                        <br><br> The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an 
                        infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, 
                        by coughing into a flexed elbow)."
                
                    <br><br>
                    <u>Symptoms:</u> <br>
                    <b>* High temperature</b> - this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back (you do not need to measure your temperature)<br>
                    <b>* Continuous cough</b> - this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or 3 or more coughing episodes in 24 hours (if you usually have a cough, it may be worse than usual)<br>
                    <b>* Loss or change to sense of smell of taste</b> - this means you've noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste different to normal
